# Introduction to Graphics
CIS 541, Fall 2016, University of Oregon

This repository contains materials used in the Fall 2016 Introduction to Graphics course (541). One of the main goals of this course was to develop a 3D rendering engine from scratch, using C++. We also did some graphics programming using the OpenGL and VTK libraries.

## Contents
* ./differencer - Small program used to compare images and verify correctness
* ./presentation - In-class presentation given on the topics of Scene Graphs and Animation
* ./project1 - Multi-stage project with the goal of building a 3D rendering engine in C++. Begins with rendering 2D triangles (A-C), and finishes with 3D rendering including shading, camera rotation, etc. (D-F)
* ./project2 - Multi-stage project with rendering using OpenGL and C++.
* ./wolf - Final project. I created a 3D model of a wolf starting from image planes. I then developed a rig  and some animation sequences.
* ./README.md - This file

## Built With

* [C++]() - Language used to develop 3D rendering engine
* [VTK](https://www.vtk.org/) - The Visualization Toolkit, used for image file IO and other features
* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) - Rendering library used in project2
* [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview) - Used to develop 3D models and animations used in presentation and final project
