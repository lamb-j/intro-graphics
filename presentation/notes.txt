Scene Graphs

  1. What is a scene graph
    - A general data structure commonly used by graphics applications which arranges logical and spactial preprenstation
    of a graphical scene.
 
    - Collection of nodes in a graph or tree structure.
      Group related objects into a compound object that can then be moved, transformed, selected as if it were a single object

  2. Motivation
    - represent connections

  3. Example using a car?


  4. Connection with Tranformation Matrices, glPush(), glPop()

  5. Other cool Stuff
    organize objects in scene
    Geometry instancing
    connection to bvh

Animation

  1. What is animation?

  2. Traditional animation

  3. Ball animation graphic

  4. 12 principles of Animation

  5. Computer Animation
    - Polygonal mesh
    - keyframes
    - interpolation 

  6. Other Cool stuff with computer animation
    - rigging
    - 3D dynamics
    - Grativy, particle simulations
